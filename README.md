# Tetris_Python
A Tetris game made using PyGame as renderer only, for a school project.

## Twist in the Game
Blocks can pentrate through right and left boundaries, i.e., you can cross the right edge to appear on the left.
## Playing It

Just run `tetris.py`, with `bg_final.jpg` and the `wav` files in the same folder. Make sure you have also installed PyGame (pip-> `pip install pygame`)

## Controls

Use right and left arrow keys to move the block left and right. Press down to drop by a line and space for complete drop. R or up arrow is used to rotate the block. And press C to pause/unpause. By default, it starts paused.

## Some info
